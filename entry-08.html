        <p>RED PILL</p> 
        <p class="pill-text"> If you chose the RED PILL, you can expect to develop a fever. This fever will take over your body and make you sweat intensely. Some of us sweat so much that our it would reopen our wounds and it would sting our eyes.</p></p>

    <p>BLUE PILL</p>
    <p class="pill-text">
        Many of us noticed that the pores on our skin started to get much larger when we consume this pill. It could be because of how cold the blue pill would make us feel; we notice that we have a lot more body hair growing on our skin and that too at an incredibly fast rate. The company claims that body hair will help us survive in extreme conditions of cold, but I doubt I would ever need to be in such a condition...unless they want me to be

Currently, it seems to be a dark green color. I cannot tell if my skin cells are even alive because I have no sense of touch whatsoever."<br><br>-Lester Gonzalves
