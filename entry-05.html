    This week Lester managed to collect messgaes from his group members' failed experiments. He sneaked into a comupter lab and recorded them digitally, while his group distracted the guards.
    <br> <br> Lester emailed his wife Emily the recorded data as well as a short note to explain the victims' unfortunate situation.

     Emily, please help me- HELP US. We need you to speak up for us and let the world know about the horrific things they are doing to us. </p>

        I miss you mom. I know this would have brought us so much money and would help us send Janine to school, but I cannot take it anymore. I will find other ways to make the money-I will find a way to get out of here. Don't you worry about me mom. Take care of yourself and Janine. I will be back soon.

        I cannot believe I went through with this decision. The worst one I ever made. But there's no point in sulking. I have to stand up for myself and get out of here. I have to talk to dad and tell him that I am sorry for leaving him and you to fend for yourelves. But I recognize my mistake now and I cannot wait to come back and fix them. I miss you and dad so much mom. Take care.

       When I went into this, I was certain I would come out a changed man; but I didnt't think it would alter me this bad. I now wish I could go back to how it was. Me, you and Bruno. Steph, I am so sorry I had to leave, but I miss you more everyday and the thought of coming home to you and Bruno is the only thing that gets me through the day here. All of this pain will end. I will come back home to you. Love you, Steph.

       Abel, I know I have been a bad brother and and even worse uncle to George. But I hope you can forgive me and help me out. I am begging you. I am in so much pain that I cannot even begin to describe. I am willing to do anything and everything to get out of here. I want to make ammends with you and be a better uncle for George, but I need you to get me out of here.
